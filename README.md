Radix is an online publication format designed for scientific and
technical communication. Radix articles include:

  - Reader-friendly typography that adapts well to mobile devices.
  - Features essential to technical writing like LaTeX math, citations,
    and footnotes.
  - Flexible figure layout options (e.g.Â displaying figures at a larger
    width than the article text).
  - Attractively rendered tables with optional support for pagination.
  - Support for a wide variety of diagramming tools for illustrating
    concepts.
  - The ability to incorporate JavaScript and D3-based interactive
    visualizations.
  - A variety of ways to publish articles, including support for
    publishing collections or articles as a Radix website.

Radix is based on the Distill web framework, which was originally
created for use in the Distill Machine Learning Journal. Radix combines
the technical authoring features of Distill with R Markdown, enabling a
fully reproducible workflow based on literate programming

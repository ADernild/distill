Distill is a new publication format created for use in <https://distill.pub>, a machine learning journal devoted to clear explanations, native to the web. The Distill format features:

- Attractive, reader-friendly typography that adapts well to mobile devices.
- Flexible layout options for visualizations, including visualizations that occupy the full  width of the screen.
- Support for features essential to technical writing like LaTeX math, footnotes, and citations.

## Getting Started

To create an [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) document that uses the Distill format, first install the **distill** R package:

```r
devtools::install_github("jjallaire/distill")
```

Next, be sure that you are running [Pandoc v2.0](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/latest) or higher (the Distill format requires a later version of Pandoc than ships by default with RStudio). You can check the current version of Pandoc with:

```r
rmarkdown::pandoc_version()
```

Then, use the **New R Markdown** dialog within RStudio to create a new Distill article:

You can also create a new Distill article from the command line with:

```r
rmarkdown::draft("article.Rmd", "distill_article", "distill")
```

Distill articles use `distill::distill_article` as their output format, and typically include title, description, and author/affiliation entires in their YAML front-matter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Article"
description: |
  A new article created using the Distill format.
authors:
  JJ Allaire: https://github.com/jjallaire
  Yihui Xie: https://github.com/yihui
affiliations:
  RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com
  RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com
output: distill::distill_article
bibliography: biblio.bib
---
```

The article's description and author bylines are automatically rendered as part of the title area of the document.

Note the `bibliography` field is used to provide a reference to the Bibtex file where all of the sources cited in your article are defined. The next section explains how to include citations in your article.

## Citations

Bibtex is the supported way of making academic citations. To include citations, first create a bibtex file and refer to it from the `bibliography` field of the YAML front-matter (as illustrated above).

For example, your bibliography file might contain:

```bibtex
@article{gregor2015draw,
  title={DRAW: A recurrent neural network for image generation},
  author={Gregor, Karol and Danihelka, Ivo and Graves, Alex and Rezende, Danilo Jimenez and Wierstra, Daan},
  journal={arXivreprint arXiv:1502.04623},
  year={2015},
  url={https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04623.pdf},
}
```

You are strongly encouraged you to populate the url bibtex field where possible so that links can be provided for citations.

Citations are then used in the article body with standard markdown notation, for example: `[@gregor2015draw]` (which references an id provided in the bibiography). Note that multiple ids (separated by semicolons) can be provided.

The citation is presented inline like this: [@gregor2015draw] (a number that displays more information on hover). If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by dispalying more information on hover. However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well---the authors are human and itâ€™s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.

## Footnotes

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a <dt-fn> tag. The number of the footnote will be automatically generated. 1

<dt-fn>This will become a hoverable footnote.</dt-fn>

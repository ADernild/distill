Distill is an online publication format devoted to clear explanations, native to the web. Distill was originally created for use in <https://distill.pub> (a machine learning journal) but is also an open-source framework available for broader use. Distill features:

- Attractive, reader-friendly typography that adapts well to mobile devices.
- Flexible layout options for visualizations, including visualizations that occupy the full  width of the screen.
- Support for features essential to technical writing like LaTeX math, footnotes, and citations.

## Getting Started

To create an [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) document that uses the Distill format, first install the **distill** R package:

```r
devtools::install_github("jjallaire/distill")
```

Next, be sure that you are running [Pandoc v2.0](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/latest) or higher (the Distill format requires a later version of Pandoc than ships by default with RStudio). You can check the current version of Pandoc with:

```r
rmarkdown::pandoc_version()
```

Then, use the **New R Markdown** dialog within RStudio to create a new Distill article:

You can also create a new Distill article from the command line with:

```r
rmarkdown::draft("article.Rmd", "distill_article", "distill")
```

Distill articles use `distill::distill_article` as their output format, and typically include title, description, and author/affiliation entires in their YAML front-matter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Article"
description: |
  A new article created using the Distill format.
authors:
  - JJ Allaire: https://github.com/jjallaire
  - Yihui Xie: https://github.com/yihui
affiliations:
  - RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com
  - RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com
output: distill::distill_article
bibliography: biblio.bib
---
```

The article's description and author bylines are automatically rendered as part of the title area of the document.

Note the `bibliography` field is used to provide a reference to the Bibtex file where all of the sources cited in your article are defined. The next section explains how to include citations in your article.

## Citations

Bibtex is the supported way of making academic citations. To include citations, first create a bibtex file and refer to it from the `bibliography` field of the YAML front-matter (as illustrated above).

For example, your bibliography file might contain:

```bibtex
@Book{xie2015,
  title = {Dynamic Documents with R and knitr},
  author = {Yihui Xie},
  publisher = {Chapman and Hall/CRC},
  address = {Boca Raton, Florida},
  year = {2015},
  edition = {2nd},
  note = {ISBN 978-1498716963},
  url = {http://yihui.name/knitr/},
}
```

You are strongly encouraged you to populate the `url` bibtex field where possible so that links can be provided for citations.

Citations are then used in the article body with standard Pandoc markdown notation, for example: `[@xie2015]` (which references an id provided in the bibiography). Note that multiple ids (separated by semicolons) can be provided.

The citation is presented inline like this: [@xie2015] (a number that displays more information on hover). If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by dispalying more information on hover. However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well---the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.

## Footnotes

Footnotes use standard Pandoc markdown notation, for example `^[This will become a hoverable footnote]`. The number of the footnote will be automatically generated. ^[This will become a hoverable footnote]

You can also optionally include notes in the gutter of the article (immediately to the right of the article text). To do this create a `<div>` with class `l-gutter`. For example:

<div class="l-gutter">
This content will appear in the gutter of the article.
</div>


```html
<div class="l-gutter">
This content will appear in the gutter of the article.
</div>
```


## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting is provided for code chunks and markdown code blocks. Note that by default the Distill format does not display the code for chunks that are evaluated to produce output (knitr option `echo = FALSE`). 

To display the code that was evaluated to produce output you can set the `echo` chunk option to `TRUE`:

    ```{r, echo=FALSE}`r ''`
    1 + 1
    ```

To include code that is only displayed and not evaluated specify the `eval=FALSE` option:

    ```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}`r ''`
    1 + 1
    ```

## Equations

Inline and display equations are supported via standard markdown [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) syntax. For example, the following [LaTeX math](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics):


    $$
    \sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i -\mu)^2}
    $$
    
Will be rendered as:

$$
\sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i -\mu)^2}
$$

## Figures

There are a variety of ways to layout figures included within Distill articles. This layout is controlled by a set of layout classes, which are in turn applied to R Markdown chunks using the `fig.layout` chunk option.

The default layout if `fig.layout` is not specified is `l-body`, which will cause figures to span with width of the main article body:

<div class="fake-img l-body"><p>l-body</p></div>

For example, a figure with the default `l-body` layout would look like this:

![](images/l-body-figure.png){.l-body}


For figures you want to display a little larger, try these:

<div class="fake-img l-middle"><p>l-middle</p></div>

<div class="fake-img l-page"><p>l-page</p></div>

For example, this plot specifies the `l-middle` layout using the `fig.layout` chunk option:

    ```{r, fig.layout="l-middle", fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5}`r ''`
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +
      facet_grid(~ cut)
    ```

![](images/l-middle-figure.png){.l-middle}


Note that when specifying an alternate `fig.layout` you should also specify and appropriate `fig.width` and `fig.height` for that layout.

All of these have an `outset` variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit. For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset"><p>l-body-outset</p></div>

<div class="fake-img l-middle-outset"><p>l-middle-outset</p></div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset"><p>l-page-outset</p></div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width. For this, use `l-screen`. You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant:

<div class="fake-img l-screen"><p>l-screen</p></div>

<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset"><p>l-screen-inset</p></div>

Often you want to position smaller figures so as not to completely interrupt the flow of your text. Or perhaps you want to put some text in the margin as an aside or to signal that it’s optional content. For these cases we’ll add the `side` class to our layouts.

<div class="fake-img l-body side"><p>l-body side</p></div>

<div class="fake-img l-middle side"><p>l-middle side</p></div>

<div class="fake-img l-page side"><p>l-page side</p></div>

They are all floated to the right and anchored to the right-hand edge of the position you specify. By default, each will take up approximately half of the width of the standard layout position.

Here's an example of floating a figure to the right using the `fig.layout` option:

    ```{r, fig.layout="l-page side", fig.width=5, fig.height=2}`r ''`
    ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, hp)) + geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
      facet_grid(~ gear)
    ```

![](images/l-page-side-figure.png){.l-page .side width=480}

The figure will be displayed to the right using the requested layout boundary. Note that we also specify values for `fig.width` and `fig.height` that are appropriate for this layout.

You can also use the same layouts with static images. In this case, just add the requisite classes using standard markdown image class syntax:

```markdown
![](images/l-middle-figure.png){.l-middle}
![](images/l-page-side-figure.png){.l-page .side width=480}
```

Note that for the side layout we also specify an explicit `width` which will constrain the image from overflowing the layout region.

### htmlwidgets

Using [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org) is very similar to using standard R figures. For example, the following code embeds a Leaflet map:

    ```{r}`r ''`
    library(leaflet)
    leaflet() %>%
      addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
      addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup="The birthplace of R")
    ```

```{r}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup="The birthplace of R")
```

If you want an htmlwidget to use one of the alternate figure layouts (e.g. `l-page`) then things work a bit differently due to the way widgets handle dynamic resizing. While you still use the `fig.layout` chunk option to specify the layout, the sizing is handled directly on the call to the htmlwidget via the `width` and `height` parameters, for example:

    ```{r, fig.layout="l-page"}`r ''`
    library(dygraphs)
    dygraph(ldeaths, width="100%", height="200px")
    ```

```{r, fig.layout="l-page"}
library(dygraphs)
dygraph(ldeaths, width="100%", height="200px") %>% 
  dyRangeSelector()
```

Note that we specify `width="100%"` to ensure that the widget always occupies the full width of the layout region.

## Diagrams

To include diagrams within a distill article, we recommend trying out the [DiagrammerR](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/) package, which enables you to generate graph diagrams using text in a markdown-like syntax.

If you need more flexibilty than DiagrammeR affords, you can also try out the [r2d3](https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3) package to include diagrams created with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).

For more highly customized static diagrams you can use a vector graphics tools like [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/), [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html), or [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/). For equations in diagrams, inkscape has a plugin to support LaTeX equations, while Illustrator integrates well with tools like Equation Maker. 


## Appendices

Appendices can be added after your article by creating a `<div>` with class `appendix`. For example:

```html
<div class="appendix">
## Acknowledgments

This is a place to recognize people and institutions. It may also be a good place
to acknowledge and cite software that makes your work possible.

## Author Contributions

We strongly encourage you to include an author contributions statement briefly 
describing what each author did.
</div>
```

Footnotes and references will be included in the same section, immediately beneath any custom appendices.

```

You can enhance Radix articles by providing metadata in a variety of ways, including:

1) Links to the article's source code repository.

2) [Creative Commons] licensing terms.

3) [Open Graph] and [Twitter Card] metadata that is automatically included when the article is shared (e.g. on Twitter or within Slack).

4) [Google Scholar] compatible citation metadata for your article as well as other works cited by your article.

## Source code repository

You can include the `repository_url` field to indicate where the source code for your article can be found. For example:

```markup
---
title: "Radix for R Markdown"
description: | 
  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web
output: radix::radix_article
repository_url: https://github.com/rstudio/radix
---
```

You can optionally also include a `compare_updates_url` to provide a URL that will show the differences between the article's current version and the version that was initially published. For example:

```markup
---
title: "Radix for R Markdown"
description: | 
  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web
output: radix::radix_article
repository_url: https://github.com/rstudio/radix
compare_updates_url: https://github.com/rstudio/radix/compare/pubv1...master
---
```

If you include one or both of these fields, then an *Updates and Corrections* appendix is automatically generated. For example:

![](images/repository-appendix.png){width=95% .screenshot}

## Creative Commons

The [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) copyright licenses and tools forge a balance inside the traditional “all rights reserved” setting that copyright law creates. These tools give everyone from individual creators to large companies and institutions a simple, standardized way to grant copyright permissions to their creative work.

Here are some of the common forms of Creative Commons content license:

| License   | Name     | Description                          |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| [CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)   | Attribution | This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. 
| [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)   | Attribution-ShareAlike  | This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This license is often compared to “copyleft” free and open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. |
| [CC BY-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)   | Attribution-NoDerivs  | This license allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as it is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to you. |
| [CC BY-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)   | Attribution-NonCommercial   | This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms. |

You can designate articles that you create as Creative Commons licensed by adding the `creative_commons` field and specifying one of the standard Creative Commons licenses. For example:

```markup
---
title: "Radix for R Markdown"
description: | 
  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web
output: radix::radix_article
creative_commons: CC BY
---
```

If you include this field then a *Reuse* appendix is automatically generated. For example:

![](images/creative-commons.png){width=95% .screenshot}

### External figures

Note that figures from external sources are explicitly carved out of the license. If you are including a figure from an external source, it's good practice to delinate this by applying the `.external` class and adding a caption indicating where it is from. For example:

```markup
![Figure from https://example.com](heatmap.png){.external width=100%}    
```

Using the `.external` class and providing a "Figure from" link makes it clear that the figure originated elsewhere (and is therefore not covered by any of your article's copyright or creative commons license grants). For example, here's how a figure taken from a Stack Overflow post might appear:

![Figure from <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12196756/>](images/heatmap.png){.external width=100%}

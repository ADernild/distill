- larger scale visualization layouts
    - iframe with npr library (pym.js) for sizing (generic) (check with shinyapps.io)
    - ggplot2 theme for distill
    - distillVisualization() top level shinyApp equivalent with distill bootstrap theme 
       - use the less compiler for this
    "full bleed"
    - crosstalk compatibility?
        - distillRow/distillCol
        
- alternative to DOI is citation (which just needs a URL)

- Google Scholar data will require us to have programmatic access to all citations
  use pandoc-citeproc to convert bibliogrpahy to json?
  https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc/blob/master/man/pandoc-citeproc.1.md

- consider supporting full ISO8601 dates (could we parse them w/o ld?)
   http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime
        
- validate that title and description are provided
  
- use lang metadata field rather than locale  
        
- may need separate metadata section in the docs
- web page metadata generation/redaction (see expandData)
- article metadata (DOI, citation, etc.)
- https://github.com/distillpub/template/blob/master/src/transforms/meta.js

- consdier using figure tag? (css advantages?)
- use pandoc filters more?

- jquery based menu that uses alternate theming

- index pages (consider using iframes for federated content authoring)
- site generation

<p>Distill is an online publication format designed for technical and academic communication. Distill articles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reader-friendly typography that adapts well to mobile devices.</li>
<li>Features essential to technical writing like <a href="#equations">LaTeX math</a>, <a href="#citations">citations</a>, and <a href="#footnotes">footnotes</a>.</li>
<li>Flexible <a href="figures.html">figure layout</a> options (e.g. displaying figures at a larger width than the article text).</li>
<li>Attractively rendered <a href="tables.html">tables</a> with optional support for pagination.</li>
<li>Support for a wide variety of <a href="diagrams.html">diagramming tools</a> for illustrating concepts.</li>
<li>A variety of ways to enhance articles with <a href="interactivity.html">interactive visualizations</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Distill web framework was originally created for use in <a href="https://distill.pub" class="uri">https://distill.pub</a> (a machine learning journal). Distill for <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a> enables you to easily author Distill articles using a fully reproducible workflow based on literate programming<span class="citation">(Knuth <a href="#ref-knuth1984">1984</a>)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>To create an <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a> document that uses the Distill format, first install the <strong>distill</strong> R package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>
devtools::install_github(&quot;jjallaire/distill&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then, use the <strong>New R Markdown</strong> dialog within RStudio to create a new Distill article:</p>
<p><img src="images/new_distill_article.png" class="screenshot" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>You can also create a new Distill article from the command line with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>
library(rmarkdown)
draft(&quot;article.Rmd&quot;, &quot;distill_article&quot;, package = &quot;distill&quot;)</code></pre>
<div id="front-matter">

</div>
<p>Distill articles use <code>distill::distill_article</code> as their output format, and typically include title, description, date, author/affiliation, and bibliography entries in their YAML front-matter:</p>
<pre class="markup"><code>

title: &quot;Distill for R Markdown&quot;
description: | 
  A format devoted to clear explanations, native to the web
date: May 4, 2018
author:
  - name: &quot;JJ Allaire&quot;
    url: https://github.com/jjallaire
    affiliation: RStudio
    affiliation_url: https://www.rstudio.com
  - name: &quot;Rich Iannone&quot;
    url: https://github.com/rich-iannone
    affiliation: RStudio
    affiliation_url: https://www.rstudio.com
  - name: &quot;Yihui Xie&quot;
    url: https://github.com/yihui
    affiliation: RStudio
    affiliation_url: https://www.rstudio.com
bibliography: biblio.bib
---</code></pre>
<p>Author entires must have at least <code>name</code> and <code>url</code> specified (the affiliation fields are optional). The <code>date</code> field should be formatted as month, day, year (various notations are supported as long as the compontents appear in that order).</p>
<p>The article’s description and author bylines are automatically rendered as part of the title area of the document.</p>
<p>The <code>bibliography</code> field is used to provide a reference to the Bibtex file where all of the sources cited in your article are defined. The <a href="#citations">citations</a> section describes how to include references to these sources in your article.</p>
<h2 id="figures">Figures</h2>
<p>Distill provides a number of options for laying out figures within your article. By default figures span the width of the main article body:</p>
<p><img src="images/l-body-figure.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>However, some figures benefit from using additional horizontal space. In this cases the <code>layout</code> chunk option enables you to specify a wide variety of other layouts.</p>
<p>For example, if we wanted to display a figure a bit outside the bounds of the article text, we could specify the <code>l-body-outset</code> layout via the <code>layout</code> chunk option:</p>
<pre class="clike"><code>
```{r, layout=&quot;l-body-outset&quot;, fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(~ cut)
```</code></pre>
<div class="layout-chunk l-body-outset">
<img src="images/l-middle-figure.png" width="576" />
</div>
<p>Note that when specifying an alternate <code>layout</code> you should also specify an appropriate <code>fig.width</code> and <code>fig.height</code> for that layout. These values don’t determine the absolute size of the figure (that’s dynamic based on the layout) but they do determine the aspect ratio of the figure.</p>
<p>See the documentation on <a href="figures.html">figure layout</a> for details on additional layout options.</p>
<h2 id="tables">Tables</h2>
<p>There are a number of options available for HTML display of data frames within Distill articles. Here, we use the <code>paged_table()</code> function to display a page-able view of the <code>mtcars</code> dataset built in to R:</p>
<pre class="clike"><code>
```{r, layout=&quot;l-body-outset&quot;}
library(rmarkdown)
paged_table(mtcars)
```</code></pre>
<div class="layout-chunk l-body-outset">
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">

<p>Note that we used <code>layout=&quot;l-body-outset&quot;</code> to cause the table to occupy slightly more horizontal space than the article text. All of available <a href="figures.html">figure layout options</a> work as expected for tables.</p>
<p>See the documentation on <a href="tables.html">table display</a> for details on the various techniques available for rendering tables.</p>
<h2 id="equations">Equations</h2>
<p>Inline and display equations are supported via standard markdown <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> syntax. For example, the following <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics">LaTeX math</a>:</p>
<pre><code>
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i -\mu)^2}
$$</code></pre>
<p>Will be rendered as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i -\mu)^2}
\]</span></p>
<h2 id="citations">Citations</h2>
<p>Bibtex is the supported way of making academic citations. To include citations, first create a bibtex file and refer to it from the <code>bibliography</code> field of the YAML front-matter (as <a href="#front-matter">illustrated above</a>).</p>
<p>For example, your bibliography file might contain:</p>
<pre class="markup"><code>
@Book{xie2015,
  title = {Dynamic Documents with R and knitr},
  author = {Yihui Xie},
  publisher = {Chapman and Hall/CRC},
  address = {Boca Raton, Florida},
  year = {2015},
  edition = {2nd},
  note = {ISBN 978-1498716963},
  url = {http://yihui.name/knitr/},
}</code></pre>
<p>You are strongly encouraged you to populate the <code>url</code> bibtex field where possible so that links can be provided for citations.</p>
<p>Citations are then used in the article body with standard Pandoc markdown notation, for example: <code>[@xie2015]</code> (which references an id provided in the bibliography). Note that multiple ids (separated by semicolons) can be provided.</p>
<p>The citation is presented inline like this: <span class="citation">(Xie <a href="#ref-xie2015">2015</a>)</span> (a number that displays more information on hover). If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.</p>
<p>Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover. However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well—the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.</p>
<h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>
<p>Footnotes use standard Pandoc markdown notation, for example <code>^[This will become a hover-able footnote]</code>. The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>You can also optionally include note in the gutter of the article (immediately to the right of the article text). To do this use the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<aside>
This content will appear in the gutter of the article.
</aside>
<pre class="html"><code>
&lt;aside&gt;
This content will appear in the gutter of the article.
&lt;/aside&gt;</code></pre>
<h2 id="code-blocks">Code Blocks</h2>
<p>Syntax highlighting is provided for knitr code chunks. Note that by default the Distill format does not display the code for chunks that are evaluated to produce output (knitr option <code>echo = FALSE</code>).</p>
<p>To display the code that was evaluated to produce output you can set the <code>echo</code> chunk option to <code>TRUE</code>:</p>
<pre class="clike"><code>
```{r, echo=TRUE}
1 + 1
```</code></pre>
<p>To include code that is only displayed and not evaluated specify the <code>eval=FALSE</code> option:</p>
<pre class="clike"><code>
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
1 + 1
```</code></pre>
<h2 id="appendices">Appendices</h2>
<p>Appendices can be added after your article by adding the <code>.appendix</code> class to any level 1 or level 2 header. For example:</p>
<pre class="html"><code>
## Acknowledgments {.appendix}

This is a place to recognize people and institutions. It may also be a good place
to acknowledge and cite software that makes your work possible.

## Author Contributions {.appendix}

We strongly encourage you to include an author contributions statement briefly 
describing what each author did.</code></pre>
<p>Footnotes and references will be included in the same section, immediately beneath any custom appendices.</p>

Radix articles support including citations and a corresponding bibliography using standard R Markdown citation syntax. Radix also provides tools for making your articles more [easily citeable](#creating-citeable-articles), as well as for generating [Google Scholar](#google-scholar-metadata) compatible citation metadata.

## Citing other works

[BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/) is the supported way of making academic citations. To include citations, first create a BibTeX file and refer to it from the `bibliography` field of the YAML front-matter. For example:

```markup
---
title: "Radix for R Markdown"
description: | 
  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web
output: radix::radix_article
date: May 4, 2018
author:
  - name: Nora Jones 
    url: https://example.com/norajones
    affiliation: Spacely Sprockets
    affiliation_url: https://example.com/spacelysprokets
bibliography: biblio.bib
---
```

Here's an example of what one of the entries in your BibTeX file might look like:

```markup
@Book{xie2015,
  title = {Dynamic Documents with R and knitr},
  author = {Yihui Xie},
  publisher = {Chapman and Hall/CRC},
  address = {Boca Raton, Florida},
  year = {2015},
  edition = {2nd},
  note = {ISBN 978-1498716963},
  url = {http://yihui.name/knitr/},
}
```

To cite this within your article, use standard R Markdown notation, for example: `[@xie2015]` (referencing an id provided in the bibliography). Note that multiple ids (separated by semicolons) can be provided.

The citation is presented inline like this: [@xie2015] (a number that displays more information on hover). If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated within it.

Radix chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover. However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well---the authors are human and itâ€™s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.

Also note that you are strongly encouraged you to populate the `url` BibTeX field where possible so that links can be provided for citations.

## Creating citeable articles

You can make it easier for others to cite your work by providing additional metadata with the YAML front-matter of your article. Citations can be provided for both articles published to the web or for articles published in journals (with or without a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/)).

### Web articles

To provide a citation for an article published to the web, include `author` and `data` metadata as well as a  `citation_url`. For example:

```markup
---
title: "Radix for R Markdown"
description: | 
  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web
date: May 4, 2018
author:
  - name: Nora Jones 
    url: https://example.com/norajones
    affiliation: Spacely Sprockets
    affiliation_url: https://example.com/spacelysprokets
citation_url: https://rstudio.github.io/radix
slug: jones2018radix
bibliography: biblio.bib
---
```

When this metadata is available, a citation appendix is automatically added to the article which looks like this:

![](images/citation.png){width=95% .screenshot}

Note that we also included a `slug` field (in this case `jones2018radix`) which affects the abbreviated version of the citation included in the BibTeX entry. If you don't provide a `slug` then one will be automatically generated.


### Journal articles

If your article is published within a Journal, you can add the following the additional fields to generate the appropriate citation entry:

| Metadata           | Description                                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `journal`          | Name of Journal published within               |
| `doi`              | Digital Object Identifier ([DOI](https://www.doi.org/)) |

Here's our previous examples amended with these fields:

```markup
---
title: "Radix for R Markdown"
description: | 
  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web
date: May 4, 2018
author:
  - name: Nora Jones 
    url: https://example.com/norajones
    affiliation: Spacely Sprockets
    affiliation_url: https://example.com/spacelysprokets
journal: "Journal of Data Science Software"
doi: "10.23915/distill.00010"
slug: jones2018radix
citation_url: https://rstudio.github.io/radix
bibliography: biblio.bib
---
```

This is how the citation is presented in the appendix:

![](images/citation-journal.png){width=95% .screenshot}

For Journal articles, the `citation_url` is included in the BibTeX entry within the `note` field.


## Google Scholar metadata

Radix articles automatically include metadata compatible with the format indexed by [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing). This makes it easy for indexing engines (Google Scholar or otherwise) to extract not only a citation for your article but also information on other sources which you cited.

For example, here is the Google Scholar metadata automatically included for the home page of the Radix website:

```html
<!--  https://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing -->
<meta name="citation_title" content="Radix for R Markdown"/>
<meta name="citation_fulltext_html_url" content="https://rstudio.github.io/radix"/>
<meta name="citation_fulltext_world_readable" content=""/>
<meta name="citation_online_date" content="2018/05/04"/>
<meta name="citation_publication_date" content="2018/05/04"/>
<meta name="citation_author" content="JJ Allaire"/>
<meta name="citation_author_institution" content="RStudio"/>
<meta name="citation_author" content="Rich Iannone"/>
<meta name="citation_author_institution" content="RStudio"/>
<meta name="citation_author" content="Yihui Xie"/>
<meta name="citation_author_institution" content="RStudio"/>
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Distill;
citation_publication_date=2016;citation_publisher=Distill Working
Group;citation_doi=10.23915/distill;citation_author=Shan Carter;
citation_author=Chirs Olah;citation_author=Arvind Satyanarayan"/>
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Literate
programming;citation_publication_date=1984;
citation_publisher=British Computer Society;citation_volume=27;
citation_author=Donald E. Knuth"/>
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Dynamic
documents with r and knitr;citation_publication_date=2015;
citation_publisher=Chapman; Hall/CRC;citation_author=Yihui Xie"/>
```

Note that the `citation_reference` fields provide information on which works your article cited.

The code above is HTML so don't worry if you aren't familiar with the syntax. The important thing to know is that citation data is provided in a way that machines can easily read and index.

If you are publishing a Journal article, there are some additional metadata fields you can provide to enhance the Google Scholar metadata generated by Radix. These include additional fields describing the Journal (`title`, `issn`, and `publisher`) as well fields describing the `volume` and `issue` in which your article was published. For example:

```markup
---
title: "Radix for R Markdown"

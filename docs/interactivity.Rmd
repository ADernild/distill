description: Enhance communication with interactive visualizations

There are a variety of ways to add interactivity to your Radix articles, including:

- Using pre-built [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org) that wrap JavaScript visualization libraries like [Leaflet](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/), [Plotly](https://plot.ly/r/), [dygraphs](http://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/), and [threejs](https://bwlewis.github.io/rthreejs/).

- Creating custom [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) interactive visualizations using the [r2d3](https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/) package.

- Using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) to create an [interactive document](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html#embedded_applications) that embeds interactive components within your article.

## htmlwidgets

Including [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org) within a Distill article is as easy as including an R plot. For example, the following code embeds a Leaflet map:

````clike
```{r}`r ''`
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup="The birthplace of R")
```
````

```{r}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup="The birthplace of R")
```

You can also use [figure layout](figures.html) options with htmlwidgets. For example, here we set `layout="l-page"` to specify that we want the widget to span the width of the page:

````clike
```{r, layout="l-page", fig.height=2}`r ''`
library(dygraphs)
dygraph(ldeaths) %>% 
  dyRangeSelector()
```
````

```{r, layout="l-page", fig.height=2}
library(dygraphs)
dygraph(ldeaths) %>% 
  dyRangeSelector()
```

Note that we specify `fig.height=2` to provide a more natural height for a widget that spans the entire width of the page.

To learn about available htmlwidgets see the [showcase page](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_leaflet.html) and the [htmlwidget gallery](http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/).


## r2d3

The [r2d3](https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/) package enables you to easily incorporate interactive graphics created using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) in your Distill articles.

For example, the following renders an interactive [Veronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) created using D3:

````clike
```{r, layout="l-page", fig.height=6}`r ''`
library(r2d3)
r2d3(script = "voronoi.js")
```
````

```{r, layout="l-page", fig.height=6}
library(r2d3)
r2d3(script = "d3/voronoi/voronoi.js")
```

Note that we specify `layout="l-page"` to indicate that we want the visualization to occupy the full width of the page.

## Shiny

You can use [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) components within your Radix articles to allow your readers to change the parameters underlying your analysis and see the results immediately. To use Shiny with Radix, first specify that you want to use the Shiny runtime with your document:

```markup
---
title: "Interactive Distill with Shiny"
output: radix::radix_article
runtime: shiny
---
```

This turns your Radix article into an [interactive document](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_shiny.html), enabling you to add Shiny inputs and output directly to the document.

Here's an example of a Radix article with interactive Shiny components (<https://jjallaire.shinyapps.io/distill-interactive-document/>):

![](images/shiny.png){width=100% .screenshot}

This was the R code used to create the interactive Shiny components:

```{r eruptions, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20),
  
  sliderInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
              min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2)
)

renderPlot({
  hist(faithful$eruptions, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
       xlab = "Duration (minutes)", main = "Geyser eruption duration")
  
  dens <- density(faithful$eruptions, adjust = input$bw_adjust)
  lines(dens, col = "blue")
})
```

There are a variety of ways to layout figures included within Distill articles. This layout is controlled by a set of layout classes, which are in turn applied to R Markdown chunks using the `distill.layout` chunk option.

The default layout if `distill.layout` is not specified is `l-body`, which will cause content to span the width of the main article body:

<div class="fake-img l-body"><p>l-body</p></div>

For example, a plot with the default `l-body` layout would look like this:

![](images/l-body-figure.png){.l-body}


For elements you want to display a little larger, try these:

<div class="fake-img l-middle"><p>l-middle</p></div>

<div class="fake-img l-page"><p>l-page</p></div>

For example, here the `l-middle` layout is selected using the `distill.layout` chunk option:

    ```{r, distill.layout="l-middle", fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5}`r ''`
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +
      facet_grid(~ cut)
    ```

![](images/l-middle-figure.png){.l-middle}


Note that when specifying an alternate `distill.layout` you should also specify an appropriate `fig.width` and `fig.height` for that layout.

All of these have an `outset` variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit. For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset"><p>l-body-outset</p></div>

<div class="fake-img l-middle-outset"><p>l-middle-outset</p></div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset"><p>l-page-outset</p></div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width. For this, use `l-screen`. You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant:

<div class="fake-img l-screen"><p>l-screen</p></div>

<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset"><p>l-screen-inset</p></div>

Often you want to position smaller figures so as not to completely interrupt the flow of your text. For these cases we’ll add the `side` class to our layouts:

<div class="fake-img l-body side"><p>l-body side</p></div>

<div class="fake-img l-middle side"><p>l-middle side</p></div>

<div class="fake-img l-page side"><p>l-page side</p></div>

They are all floated to the right and anchored to the right-hand edge of the position you specify. By default, each will take up approximately half of the width of the standard layout position.

Here's an example of floating a figure to the right using the `distill.layout` option:

    ```{r, distill.layout="l-page side", fig.width=5, fig.height=2}`r ''`
    ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, hp)) + geom_point() + 
      geom_smooth(method = 'lm') +
      facet_grid(~ gear)
    ```

![](images/l-page-side-figure.png){.l-page .side width=480}

The figure will be displayed to the right using the requested layout boundary. Note that we also specify values for `fig.width` and `fig.height` that are appropriate for this layout.

You can also use the same layouts with static images not generated by R code chunks. In this case, just add the requisite classes using standard markdown image class syntax:

```markdown
![](images/l-middle-figure.png){.l-middle}
![](images/l-page-side-figure.png){.l-page .side width=480}
```

Note that for the side layout we also specify an explicit `width` which will constrain the image from overflowing the layout region.

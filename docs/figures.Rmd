```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
```


There are a variety of ways to layout figures included within Radix articles. This layout is controlled by a set of layout classes, which are in turn applied to R Markdown chunks using the `layout` chunk option.

The default layout if `layout` is not specified is `l-body`, which will cause content to span the width of the main article body:

<div class="fake-img l-body"><p>l-body</p></div>

For example, a plot with the default `l-body` layout would look like this:

```{r, layout="l-body"}
include_graphics("images/l-body-figure.png")
```


For elements you want to display a little larger, try `l-body-outset` or `l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset"><p>l-body-outset</p></div>

<div class="fake-img l-page"><p>l-page</p></div>

For example, here the `l-body-outset` layout is selected using the `layout` chunk option:

````clike
```{r, layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5}`r ''`
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(~ cut)
```
````
    
```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}
include_graphics("images/l-middle-figure.png")
```

Note that when specifying an alternate `layout` you should also specify an appropriate `fig.width` and `fig.height` for that layout.

Occasionally youâ€™ll want to use the full browser width. For this, use `l-screen`:

<div class="fake-img l-screen"><p>l-screen</p></div>

If you want a bit space at the edges then you can use the `l-screen-inset` layout, which adds 15 pixels of padding to each side. Here we use `l-screen-inset` to display a Leaflet map:

````clike
```{r, layout="l-screen-inset"}`r ''`
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup="The birthplace of R")
```
````

```{r, layout="l-screen-inset"}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=174.768, lat=-36.852, popup="The birthplace of R")
```



### Static images

To include static images that occupy the full width of the article text, be sure to add the `width=100%` attribute. For example:

```markdown
![](images/figure.png){width=100%}    
```

To include a static images that adheres to a Radix layout, wrap it in a `<div>` tag with the appropriate `class`. For example:

```markdown
<div class="l-body-outset">
![](images/figure.png){width=100%}  
</div>
```

If you are including a figure from an external source, it's good practice to delineate this by applying the `.external` class and adding a caption indicating where it is from. For example:

```markup
![Figure from https://example.com](heatmap.png){.external width=100%}    
```

Using the `.external` class and providing a "Figure from" link makes it clear that the figure originated elsewhere (and is therefore not covered by any of your article's copyright or creative commons license grants). For example, here's how a figure taken from a Stack Overflow post might appear:

![Figure from <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12196756/>](images/heatmap.png){.external width=100%}

There are a variety of ways to layout figures included within Distill articles. This layout is controlled by a set of layout classes, which are in turn applied to R Markdown chunks using the `distill.layout` chunk option.

The default layout if `distill.layout` is not specified is `l-body`, which will cause content to span the width of the main article body:

<div class="fake-img l-body"><p>l-body</p></div>

For example, a plot with the default `l-body` layout would look like this:

```{r, distill.layout="l-body"}
include_graphics("images/l-body-figure.png")
```


For elements you want to display a little larger, try `l-body-outset` or `l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset"><p>l-body-outset</p></div>

<div class="fake-img l-page"><p>l-page</p></div>

For example, here the `l-body-outset` layout is selected using the `distill.layout` chunk option:

````clike
```{r, distill.layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5}`r ''`
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(~ cut)
```
````
    
```{r, distill.layout="l-body-outset"}
include_graphics("images/l-middle-figure.png")
```

Note that when specifying an alternate `distill.layout` you should also specify an appropriate `fig.width` and `fig.height` for that layout.

Occasionally youâ€™ll want to use the full browser width. For this, use `l-screen`:

<div class="fake-img l-screen"><p>l-screen</p></div>

If you want a bit space at the edges then you can use the `l-screen-inset` layout, which adds 15 pixels of padding to each side.


### Static images

To include static images that occupy the full width of the article text, be sure to add the `width=100%` attribute. For example:

```markdown
![](images/figure.png){width=100%}    
```

To include a static images that adheres to a Disill layout, wrap it in a `<div>` tag with the appropriate `class`. For example:

```markdown
<div class="l-body-outset">
![](images/figure.png){width=100%}  
</div>
```

Alternatively, you can use the `knitr::include_graphics()` function within an R code chunk:

````clike
```{r, distill.layout="l-body-outset"}`r ''`
library(knitr)
include_graphics("images/figure.png")
```
````

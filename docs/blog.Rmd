```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
```

Radix websites include integrated support for blogging. To create a blog you author a collection of posts (located in the `_posts` subdirectory of your website) and then dedicate a page (usually the website homepage) to a listing of all of your posts.

## Getting started

First, create the basic scaffolding for a Radix website as described in the article on [creating websites](website.html).

For a blog, there are a couple of additional metadata items you'll want to add to your `_site.yml` so that it's easier to share the content on the blog via RSS and social networks like Twitter:

- A short `description` of the site. This field is used for the channel description of your RSS feed.

- A `base_url` for the site (the URL where it will be published to). This is used both for RSS feed items and for sharing posts via [Open Graph](metadata.html#open-graph) and [Twitter Card](metadata.html#twitter-card).

For example:

**\_site.yml**

```markup
name: "reproducible-finance-with-r"
title: "Reproducible Finance with R"
description: |
  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical 
  computing environment.
base_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3776/
navbar:
  logo: images/rstudio.png
  right:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
    - text: "Contributors"
      href: contributors.html
    - icon: fa fa-rss
      href: index.xml
output: radix::radix_article
```

Note that we've also added a feed icon to the right side of the menu bar which makes it easy to discover and browse the RSS feed for the blog.

### Creating a post

To create a post, simply create a sub-directory of the `_posts` directory and save a Radix article there. For example:

```r
dir.create("_posts/sharpe-ratio", recursive = TRUE)
```

Here's what `sharpe_ratio.Rmd` might look like to start with:

**\_posts/sharpe-ratio/sharpe-ratio.Rmd**

```markup
---
title: "The Sharpe Ratio"
description: |
  In this post we present a classic finance use case using the
  PerformanceAnalytics, quantmod, and dygraphs packages. 
  We'll demonstrate importing stock data, building a portfolio,
  and then calculating the Sharpe Ratio.

    affiliation: RStudio
    affiliation_url: https://www.rstudio.com
date: 11-09-2016
output: 
  radix::radix_article:
    self_contained: false
---
```

Note that we set `self_contained` to `false` since this article will be published as part of a website.

You work on blog posts independent of the enclosing website (use **Knit** to render preview the post just like any R Markdown document). This is in fact the only way to update post content --- posts are considered standalone documents that are not re-rendered when the site is built. This is because posts are often expensive to render and have R package dependencies that may be difficult to satisfy as time goes on.

In the next section will describe how to create a listing page for all of your posts.


### Listing pages

Once you have authored one or more posts you'll want to create a listing page. You can do this by adding a `listing` metadata entry to the page you to include the listing on. This is often the main page for the website (index.Rmd). For example:

**index.Rmd**

```markup
---
title: "Reproducible Finance with R"
site: radix::radix_website
listing: posts
---
```

In our [example blog](https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3776/) (which will be described in more detail below) this results in the following listing:

![](images/site-listing.png){width=95% .screenshot}

#### Categories

If your posts include `categories` metadata, then the page will also include category links to the right of the article listing. For example, here is some post metadata that includes categories:

```markup
---
title: "The Sharpe Ratio"
# (additional metadata e.g. description and date, excluded for brevity)
categories:
  - portfolios
  - dygraphs
```

As a result of including `categories`, the listing page now looks like this:

![](images/site-listing-categories.png){width=95% .screenshot}


### RSS feeds

When you create a listing page an [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) is created automatically for the page (using the name of the listing page with a `.xml` file extension). You can link to the RSS feed within your site's navigation bar as follows (some navbar entries excluded for brevity):

**\_site.yml**

```markup
name: "reproducible-finance-with-r"
title: "Reproducible Finance with R"
description: |
  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical 
  computing environment.
base_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3776/
navbar:
  right:
    - icon: fa fa-rss
      href: index.xml
output: radix::radix_article
```

Note that the `description` and `base_url` fields are both required to generate an RSS feed.

By default the most recent 20 articles will be included in the RSS feed. You can change this by specifying `feed_items_max` within the collection configuration in `_site.yml` (navbar and output format fields omitted for brevity):

**\_site.yml**

```markup
name: "reproducible-finance-with-r"
title: "Reproducible Finance with R"
description: |
  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical 
  computing environment.
base_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3776/
collections:
  posts:
    feed_items_max: 50
```

Specify `feed_items_max: false` to have no limit on the number of items included in the feed.

### Post drafts

If you want to work on a post for a period of time without having it be added to the listing page, add `draft: true` to the post's metadata. For example:

```markup
---
title: "The Sharpe Ratio"
description: |
  In this post we present a classic finance use case using the
  PerformanceAnalytics, quantmod, and dygraphs packages. 
  We'll demonstrate importing stock data, building a portfolio,
  and then calculating the Sharpe Ratio. 
draft: true
---
```

When you are ready to publish the post, either remove the `draft` option or set it to `false`, then build the website.

## Next steps

### Comments and sharing

Readers will likely want to comment on and share articles they read on your blog. You can enable support for [Disqus comments](https://disqus.com/) and sharing links for Twitter, LinkedIn, and other services by adding options to the `collection:posts` section of `_site.yml`.

For example, the following options provide the [Disqus shortname](https://help.disqus.com/installation/whats-a-shortname) for a site and specify that we want sharing buttons for Twitter and LinkedIn. 

**\_site.yml**

```markup
---
name: "reproducible-finance-with-r"
title: "Reproducible Finance with R"
description: |
  Exploring reproducible finance with the R statistical 
  computing environment.
base_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3776/
collections:
  posts:
    disqus: reproducible-finance-with-r
    share: [twitter, linkedin]
---
```

The following footer is then automatically included at the end of each post:

![](images/social-footer.png){width=80% .screenshot}

Note that the `base_url` field is required in order to use Disqus and sharing links.

Valid values for the `share` option are `twitter`, `linkedin`, `facebook`, `google-plus`, and `pintrest`.


### Organizing posts

You can use whatever scheme you like to organize the `_posts` directory. You can have all posts at the top level or you can create subdirectories to create groupings of posts.

One popular scheme for organizing blog posts is to use a date prefix for the post directory names. For example:

```markup
_posts/
  2017-11-09-visualizing-asset-returns/
  2017-09-13-asset-volatility/
  2017-03-07-quandl-and-forecasting/
  2016-11-08-sharpe_ratio/
```

The benefits of this scheme are that post names are given additional uniqueness (to guard against colliding names over the long term) and are also automatically listed in order when browsing the `_posts` directory.

Note that if you use a date-prefixed post directory you are not required to specify an explicit `date` field within your post's metadata.

### Preview images

Note that the listing for our example above includes a preview image for each post. Preview thumbnail images are generated automatically based on the first plot encountered within your post. You can specify that a specific plot should be used as the preview image using the `preview` chunk option. For example:

````clike
```{r, layout="l-body-outset", preview=TRUE}`r ''`
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(~ cut)
```
````

If you want to use another image entirely as a post preview you add a `preview` field to the post's metadata. For example, here we add a `preview` field to the example metadata from above (some fields excluded for brevity):

```markup
---
title: "The Sharpe Ratio"
description: |
  In this post we present a classic finance use case using the
  PerformanceAnalytics, quantmod, and dygraphs packages. 
  We'll demonstrate importing stock data, building a portfolio,
  and then calculating the Sharpe Ratio. 
preview: images/sharpe-ratio.png
---
```

Preview images are also used for generating [Open Graph](metadata.html#open-graph) and [Twitter Card](metadata.html#twitter-card) metadata. However, since those systems require that preview images be specified as absolute URLs, you also need to add a `base_url` field to your `_site.yml` file as describe above in [Getting Started].


### Supporting files

When a blog post is published, resource files located alongside the post in it's directory are also published. The following files are *not* published by default:

1. Files beginning with `"."` (hidden files).

2. Files beginning with `"_"`

3. Files known to contain R source code (e.g. `".R"`, `".s"`, `".Rmd"`), R data (e.g. `".RData"`, `".rds"`), or configuration data (e.g. `"rsconnect"` ,`"packrat"`)).

You can override this behavior using a `resources` metadata entry for your post, which can specify explicit files to `include` or `exclude`. For example (some fields excluded for brevity):

```markup
---
title: "The Sharpe Ratio"
description: |
  In this post we present a classic finance use case using the
  PerformanceAnalytics, quantmod, and dygraphs packages. 
  We'll demonstrate importing stock data, building a portfolio,
  and then calculating the Sharpe Ratio. 
resources:
  exclude:
    *.csv    
---
```

### Sidebar content

You can add additional content to the sidebar area where [categories] are located by including a `:::: sidebar` markup section within your listing page. For example:

```markup
---
title: "Reproducible Finance with R"
site: radix::radix_website
listing: posts
---

:::: sidebar 

### Subscribe

Subscribe to this blog at <https://example.com/subscribe>.

::::
```

As demonstrated above, you should use level 3 headings (`###`) to delinate the various sections of sidebar content you add.

## Publishing a blog

After you've authored one or more posts you will want to build the entire site before publshing it. 

If your Radix website is contained within an RStudio project you can use the **Build Website** command available in the Build pane to generate the site:

![](images/build-website.png){width=95% .screenshot}

To build a website from the command line, use the `rmarkdown::render_site()` function:

```r
library(rmarkdown)
render_site()
```

There are a variety of options available for making your site available to others, see the article on [website publishing](publish_website.html) for details. 


## Examples

There is a complete example of a blog built with Radix available at <https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3776/>.

The example reproduces several posts from the [Reproducible Finance with R](https://rviews.rstudio.com/categories/reproducible-finance-with-r/) series on the R Views blog.

The source code for the example can be found here: <https://github.com/radixpub/radix-r/tree/master/examples/websites/reproducible-finance-with-r>.

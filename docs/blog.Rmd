description: Create a blog to publish a collection of Radix articles

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
```

Radix websites include integrated support for blogging. To create a blog you author a collection of posts (located in the `_posts` subdirectory of your website) and then dedicate a page (usually the website homepage) to a listing of all of your posts.

## Getting started

First, create the basic scaffolding for a Radix website as described in the article on [creating websites](website.html).

Then, from the main directory of your website, create a `_posts` subdirectory:

```r
dir.create("_posts")
```

## Creating a post

To create a post, simply create a sub-directory of the `_posts` directory and save a Radix article there. For example:

```r
dir.create("_posts/sharpe-ratio")
```

Here's what `sharpe_ratio.Rmd` might look like to start with:

**\_posts/sharpe-ratio/sharpe-ratio.Rmd**

```markup

title: "The Sharpe Ratio"
description: |
  In this post we present a classic finance use case using the
  PerformanceAnalytics, quantmod, and dygraphs packages. 
  We'll demonstrate importing stock data, building a portfolio,
  and then calculating the Sharpe Ratio.

output: 
  radix::radix_article:
    self_contained: false
---
```

Note that we set `self_contained` to `false` since this article will be published as part of a website.

You can work on the post independent of the containing website (use **Knit** to preview the post just like any R Markdown document). In the next section will describe how to create a listing page for all of your posts.

## Listing pages

Once you have authored one or more posts you'll want to create a listing page. You can do this by adding a `listing` metadata entry to the page you to include the listing on. This is often the main page for the website (index.Rmd). For example:

**index.Rmd**

```markup
---
title: "Reproducible Finance with R"
site: radix::radix_website
listing:
  collection: posts
---
```

In our [example blog](https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3776/) (which will be described in more detail below) this results in the following listing:

![](images/site-listing.png){width=95% .screenshot}

### Post drafts

If you want to work on a post for a period of time without having it be added to the listing page, add `draft: true` to the post's metadata. For example:

```markup
---
title: "The Sharpe Ratio"
description: |
  In this post we present a classic finance use case using the
  PerformanceAnalytics, quantmod, and dygraphs packages. 
  We'll demonstrate importing stock data, building a portfolio,
  and then calculating the Sharpe Ratio. 
draft: true
---
```

When you are ready to publish the post, either remove the `draft` option or set it to `false`, then build the website.


## Preview thumbnail

Note that the listing for our example above includes a preview image for each post. Preview thumbnail images are generated automatically based on the first plot encountered within your post. You can specify that a specific plot should be used as the preview image using the `preview` chunk option. For example:

````clike
```{r, layout="l-body-outset", preview=TRUE}`r ''`
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(~ cut)
```
````

If you want to use another image entirely as a post preview you add a `preview` field to the post's metadata. For example, here we add a `preview` field to the example metadata from above (some fields excluded for brevity):

```markup
---
title: "The Sharpe Ratio"
description: |
  In this post we present a classic finance use case using the
  PerformanceAnalytics, quantmod, and dygraphs packages. 
  We'll demonstrate importing stock data, building a portfolio,
  and then calculating the Sharpe Ratio. 
preview: images/sharpe-ratio.png
---
```

Preview images are also used for generating [Open Graph](metadata.html#open-graph) and [Twitter Card](metadata.html#twitter-card) metadata. However, since those systems require that preview images be specified as absolute URLs, you  need to add a `base_url` field to your `_site.yml` to indicate where your site will be deployed. For example:

**\_site.yml**

```markup
name: "reproducible-finance-with-r"
title: "Reproducible Finance with R"
base_url: https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3776/
navbar:
  logo: images/rstudio.png
  right:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
    - text: "Contributors"
      href: contributors.html
output: radix::radix_article
```


## Building the site

After you've authored one or more posts you will want to build the entire site before deploying it. 

If your Radix website is contained within an RStudio project you can use the **Build Website** command available in the Build pane to generate the site:

![](images/build-website.png){width=95% .screenshot}

To build a website from the command line, use the `rmarkdown::render_site()` function:

```r
library(rmarkdown)
render_site()
```

There are a variety of options available for making your site available to others, see the article on [website publishing](publish_website.html) for details. 

## Example

There is a complete example of a blog built with Radix available at <https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/content/3776/>.

The example reproduces several posts from the [Reproducible Finance with R](https://rviews.rstudio.com/categories/reproducible-finance-with-r/) series on the R Views blog.

The source code for the example can be found here: <https://github.com/radixpub/radix-r/tree/master/examples/websites/reproducible-finance-with-r>.

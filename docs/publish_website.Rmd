This article describes how to publish several Radix articles together as a website.  Radix websites include a common navigation bar that enables readers to discover and browse collections of articles. For example, the documentation pages you are reading now are a Radix website. 

## Simple Example

To start with let's walk through a very simple example, a website that includes two pages (Home and About) and a navigation bar to switch between them:

**\_site.yml**

```markup
---
name: "radix-rmarkdown"
title: "Radix for R Markdown"
navbar:
  right:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
    - icon: fa-github
      href: https://github.com/rstudio/radix
output: radix::radix_article
---
```

**index.Rmd**

```markup
---
title: "Radix for R Markdown"
description: | 
  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web
---

Hello, Radix!
```

**about.Rmd**

```markup
---
title: "About Radix"
description: |
  Some additional details about the Radix project
---

```

Note that the minimum requirement for any website is that it have an `index.Rmd` file as well as a `_site.yml` file. Note also that the `output` options are not specified within the Rmd documents but rather in the `_site.yml` configuration file (this allows output options to be shared by all articles).

## Authoring and Previewing

If you execute the `rmarkdown::render_site` function from within the directory containing the website the following will occur:

1. All of the Rmd and md files in the root website directory will be rendered into HTML. Note however that markdown files beginning with "_" are not rendered (this is a convention to designate files that are included by top level documents).

2. The generated HTML files and any supporting files (e.g. CSS and JavaScript) are copied into an output directory (`_site` by default).

The HTML files within the `_site` directory are now ready to deploy as a standalone static website. 

If you are using RStudio you can also use the **Build Website** command available in the Build pane:

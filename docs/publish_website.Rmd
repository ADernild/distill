```

This article describes how to create a website that contains a collection of Radix articles. Radix websites include a top level navigation bar that enables readers to discover and browse articles. For example, the documentation pages you are reading now are a Radix website. 

Once you've created your website locally, the are a variety of ways available to [publish your site to the web](#publishing).  

## Getting Started

The minimum requirement for a Radix website is that it have an `index.Rmd` file as well as a `_site.yml` file (this is where site related options and configuration are specified).

Let's walk through a very simple example, a website that includes two pages (Home and About) and a navigation bar to switch between them:

**\_site.yml**

```markup
---
name: "radix-rmarkdown"
title: "Radix for R Markdown"
navbar:
  right:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
    - icon: fa-github
      href: https://github.com/rstudio/radix
output: radix::radix_article
---
```

**index.Rmd**

```markup
---
title: "Radix for R Markdown"
description: | 
  Scientific and technical writing, native to the web
---

Hello, Radix!
```

**about.Rmd**

```markup
---
title: "About Radix"
description: |
  Some additional details about the Radix project
---

More about Radix
```
 
Note that the `output` options are not specified within the Rmd documents but rather in the `_site.yml` configuration file (this allows output options to be shared by all articles).

## Authoring and Previewing

To build the website, use the `rmarkdown::render_site()` function:

```r
library(rmarkdown)
render_site()
```

When you execute this function from within the directory containing the website, the following occurs:

1. All of the Rmd and md files in the root website directory will be rendered into HTML. Note however that markdown files beginning with "_" are not rendered (this is a convention to designate files that are included by top level documents).

2. The generated HTML files and any supporting files (e.g. CSS and JavaScript) are copied into an output directory (`_site` by default).

The HTML files within the `_site` directory are now ready to deploy as a standalone static website. 

If your Radix website is contained within an RStudio project you can also use the **Build Website** command available in the Build pane:

![](images/build-website.png){width=95% .screenshot}

You can also preview a single article from within the website by passing the name of the article's Rmd file to `render_site()`:

```r
render_site("about.Rmd")
```

This will build only the specified article (as opposed to all of the articles in the site). If you use the **Knit** command from within RStudio on a Radix article within a website it will also render and preview just that article.

The R Markdown documentation on [creating websites](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html) has additional documentation on additional available features and configuration options. The remainder of this article describes features that are specific to Radix websites.

## Site Navigation

Site navigation bars include the site's title, an optional logo, top-level links to articles, and if need be drop-down menus that include links to several articles. For example:

![](images/navigation-bar.png){width=95% .screenshot}

Elements of the site navigation bar are specified within the `navbar` section of the `_site.yml` file. For example, here is the YAML that was used to create the navigation bar displayed above:

```markup
---
name: "radix"
title: "Radix for R Markdown"
navbar:
  logo:
    image: images/logo.png
    href: https://www.rstudio.com
  right:
    - text: "Figures"
      href: figures.html
    - text: "Tables"
      href: tables.html
    - text: "Citations"
      href: citations.html
    - text: "Publish"
      menu:
        - text: "Publishing Articles"
          href: publish_article.html
        - text: "Publishing a Website"
          href: publish_website.html
        - text: "---"
        - text: "Article Metadata"
          href: metadata.html
    - icon: fa-github
      href: https://github.com/rstudio/radix
output: distill::distill_article
---
```

Note that we specify that the menu items appear on the `right` side of the navigation bar. We could have also used `left`, or chosen to put some items on the `left` and some on the `right`. 

Note also that we used an `icon` for one of the menus, specifying the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/) `fa-github` identifer for the GitHub icon (you can use any Font Awesome 4.0 icon).

### Site Footer

When you use a navigation bar, you can optionally also include a site footer which uses the same theme (background and foreground colors). For example:

![](images/footer-bar.png){width=95% .screenshot}

To add a footer, simply include a file named `footer.html` within your main site directory. For example:

**footer.html**

```markup

(https://github.com/distillpub/template/blob/master/AUTHORS) 
and [RStudio, Inc](https://www.rstudio.com).

Software licensed under the [Apache License, v2.0]
(https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
```

### Theming

You can use CSS to create an alternate theme for your navigation bar and site footer. Here is the CSS used for the default appearance:

```css
.radix-site-nav {
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);
  background-color: #455a64;
  font-size: 15px;
  font-weight: 300;
}

.radix-site-nav a {
  color: inherit;
  text-decoration: none;
}

.radix-site-nav a:hover {
  color: white;
}

.radix-site-header {
}

.radix-site-footer {
}

@media print {
  .radix-site-nav {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

The `radix-site-nav` class addresses both the header and footer, whereas the `radix-site-header` and `radix-site-footer` apply (respectively) to just the header and footer.

To override all or part of this CSS, simply include a `styles.css` file in the main site directory and add a reference to it within your site output options. For example: 

**\_site.yml**

```markup
name: "radix"
title: "Radix for R Markdown"
navbar:
  # (navbar definition here)
output:
  radix::radix_article:
    css: styles.css
```

## Site Metadata

Radix articles can include various types of [metadata](metadata.html) to make them easier to index, cite, and share. Metadata included within your `_site.yml` file is conveniently shared across all articles on your site (individual articles can always override any value within their own metadata). 

Several metadata values which you might find useful to define in `_site.yml` are:
